<h3>🧠 Reminder: How Your Feedback Shapes the Feed</h3>
<p>To avoid overfitting or blinkering, your feedback is interpreted in one of three ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅ <strong>Useful</strong> — show more like this</li>
    <li>❌ <strong>Not useful</strong> — de-prioritize similar framing</li>
    <li>🧭 <strong>Interesting or new</strong> — keep this kind of variety even if it’s not a direct hit</li>
</ul>
<p>A few wildcard or “curveball” stories will always be included to preserve breadth and discovery. You can use feedback like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>🌀 “Glad this was included, even if not quite right”</li>
    <li>⚖️ “Still unsure — let’s keep watching this space”</li>
</ul>
<h3>How We Can Design Around That</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Separate “relevance” from “exploration”</strong><br>
        Not all feedback is treated as a signal to exclude or replicate.<br>
        You’ll be able to say:<br>
        - “This was useful — include more like this” ✅<br>
        - “This was off — don’t prioritize it” ❌<br>
        - “This was new to me — not sure yet, but I’m glad it was included” 👀
    </li>
    <li><strong>Keep a quota of wildcards or long-tails</strong><br>
        Each digest can reserve one or two slots for unusual, experimental, or thought-provoking stories.<br>
        These are marked as “🧭 Explorer Picks” or “🌀 Curveballs”.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tag your feedback as “clarifying,” not “cutting”</strong><br>
        “This wasn’t very useful today, but don’t filter all stories like this out.”<br>
        “This didn’t land, but it’s good to keep variety.”<br>
        That tells the system: learn how to present better, not eliminate the category.
    </li>
</ol>
